# Faculty-Facilitation-System

• Designed a website that assigned “points” to a professor based on 
involvement at conferences, FDP (faculty development program), 
journals, publications, projects, etc. 

• Built this website on Spyder using Flask framework.

• Utilized Xampp Server along with Spyder and PhpMyAdmin to 
develop and connect the database to the website
